# QPAD: Calibrating indices of avian density from non-standardized survey data

The `QPAD` package contains **estimates** of singing rates and effective
detection distances for North American boreal breeding bird species,
following the methodology 
described in Solymos et al. (2013). **Estimating procedures** described 
in Solymos et al. (2013) can be found in the
[`detect`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=detect) R package.

## Install

Get the recent version as:
```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("psolymos/QPAD")
```
